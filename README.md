# CNN_Waste_Segregation_Assignment
## Problem Statement

Improper waste disposal contributes to environmental degradation, increased landfill waste and inefficient recycling processes. Manual sorting is labour-intensive, error-prone and costly. An AI-powered waste classification system addresses these challenges by streamlining waste segregation, reducing operational costs and improving recycling rates.
 

Key business benefits include:

Automated waste sorting, cutting time and labour
Increased recycling rated by precise classification of recyclables
Use Cases:
* Smart Recycling Bins
* Automated Waste Sorting Facilities
* Waste Monitoring and Reporting

The dataset consists of images of some common waste material categories. The images are classified into seven categories, namely: Food Waste, Metal, Paper, Plastic, Other, Cardboard, and Glass. 

The source data set contains seven folders, one containing images of each waste category.
Approximately 7,000 raw images are divided among the categories.
The data set consists of multiple folders, each representing a specific class, such as Cardboard, Food_Waste and Metal.
Each folder contains images of objects that belong to that category. However, these items are not further subcategorised.
For instance, the Food_Waste folder may contain images of items such as coffee grounds, tea bags and fruit peels without explicitly stating that they are coffee grounds or tea bags.
